## About The Project

React Runner is an AI-powered 2D game built using React.js, Node.js, and Tensorflow.js. Our goal was to create a relaxing game, with minimal UI, and easy controls. The game allows the user to control a character with voice commands. For each successful jump, a point is added to the total. When the character collides with an obstacle, a local high score is updated, and then the user can try again to reach a higher score. We built this project in a week for the August [Mintbean](https://info.mintbean.io/) hackathon.

The developers:
* [William Gerard](https://github.com/wil-gerard)
